Predicting the Price of a House.
   > a) Defining the Question
   > 
As a Data Scientist, I have been recruited to work for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. I have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.
  > b) Defining the Metric for Success
  > 
This project will be successful when:

         >  1)We Identify the most crucial independent variables that affect house prices.

         >  2)The Regression model achieves atleast 80% accuracy

         >  3)Have the lowest RMSE score possible
          

   > c) Understanding the context
   > 
   > HassConsult offers investment-grade developments all over the City. The developments have been conceptualized by their development team to be high quality assets using a data-driven approach in planning and design, that gears property for high rental returns and an escalated rate of capital growth.

   >  d)Experimental Design
   >  
   > The project was undertaken using the following design Datasets(Independent Project Week 7 - house_data.csv)

* Performing EDA

* Feature Engineering

* Multiple Linear Regression

* Quantile regression

* Ridge Regression

* Lasso Regression

* Elastic-Net Regression

* Computing the RMSE

* Plotting residual plots

* Assess their heteroscedasticity using Barlette's test

* Challenging the solution
>  Conclusion

   > e) Data Relevance
> The relavance of our data will be answered by the following questions.

> How accurate is the data at predicting the Price of a house?

> Was the dataset sufficient?

> Was the data biased?

> Is the data source a reliable source?
